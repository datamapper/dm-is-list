    # Lets say we have a User class, and we want to give users the possibility of
    # having their own todo-lists.

    #   class User
    #     include DataMapper::Resource
    #
    #     property :id, Serial
    #     property :name, String

    #
    # == Movements of list items
    #
    # Any list item can be moved around <b>within the same list</b> easily through the <tt>move</tt> method.
    #
    #
    # === move( vector )
    #
    # There are number of convenient vectors that help you move items around within the list.
    #
    #  item = Todo.get(1)
    #  other = Todo.get(2)
    #
    #  item.move(:highest)          # moves to top of list.
    #  item.move(:lowest)           # moves to bottom of list.
    #  item.move(:top)              # moves to top of list.
    #  item.move(:bottom)           # moves to bottom of list.
    #  item.move(:up)               # moves one up (:higher and :up is the same) within the scope.
    #  item.move(:down)             # moves one up (:lower and :down is the same) within the scope.
    #  item.move(:to => position)   # moves item to a specific position.
    #  item.move(:above => other)   # moves item above the other item.*
    #  item.move(:below => other)   # moves item above the other item.*
    #
    #  # * won't move if the other item is in another scope. (should this be enabled?)
    #
    # The list will act as intelligently as possible and keep positions in a logical running order.
    #
    #
    # === move( Integer )
    #
    # <b>NOTE! VERY IMPORTANT!</b>
    #
    # If you set the position manually, and then save, <b>the list will NOT reorganize itself</b>.
    #
    #  item.position = 3      # setting position manually
    #  item.save              # the item will now have position 3, but the list may have two items with the same position.
    #
    #  # alternatively
    #  item.update(:position => 3)    # sets the position manually, but does not reorganize the list positions.
    #
    #
    # You should therefore <b>always use</b> the <tt>item.move(N)</tt> syntax instead.
    #
    #   item.move(3)          # does the same as above, but in one call AND *reorganizes* the list.
    #
    # <hr>
    #
    # <b>Hold On!</b>
    #
    # <tt>dm-is-list</tt> used to work with <tt>item.position = 1</tt> type syntax.  Why this change?
    #
    # The main reason behind this change was that the previous version of <tt>dm-is-list</tt> created a LOT of
    # extra SQL queries in order to support the manual updating of position, and as a result had a quite a few bugs/issues,
    # which have been fixed in this version.
    #
    # The other reason is that I couldn't work out how to keep the functionality without adding the extra queries. But perhaps you can ?
    #
    # <hr>
    #
    # See "<b>Batch Changing Positions</b>" below for information on how to change the positions on a whole list.
    #
    # == Movements between scopes
    #
    # When you move items between scopes, the list will try to work with your intentions.
    #
    #
    # Move the item from list to new list and add the item to the bottom of that list.
    #
    #  item.user_id               # => 1
    #  item.move_to_list(10)      # => the scope id ie User.get(10).id
    #
    #  # results in...
    #  item.user_id                 # => 10
    #  item.position                # => < bottom of the list >
    #
    #
    # Move the item from list to new list and add at the position given.
    #
    #  item.user_id                 # => 1
    #  item.move_to_list(10, 2)     # => the scope id ie User.get(10).id,  position => 2
    #
    #  # results in...
    #  item.user_id                 # => 10
    #  item.position                # => 2
    #
    #
    # == Batch Changing Positions
    #
    # A common scenario when working with lists is the sorting of a whole list via something like JQuery's sortable() functionality.
    # <br>
    # (Think re-arranging the order of Todo's according to priority or something similar)
    #
    #
    # === Optimum scenario
    #
    # The most SQL query efficient way of changing the positions is:
    #
    #
    #   sort_order = [5,4,3,2,1]              # list from AJAX request..
    #
    #   items = Todo.all(:user => @u1)        # loads all 5 items in the list
    #
    #   items.each{ |item| item.update(:position => sort_order.index(item.id) + 1) }   # remember the +1 since array's are indexed from 0
    #
    #
    # The above code will result in something like these queries.
    #
    #   # SELECT "id", "title", "position", "user_id" FROM "todos" WHERE "user_id" = 1 ORDER BY "position"
    #   # UPDATE "todos" SET "position" = 5 WHERE "id" = 1
    #   # UPDATE "todos" SET "position" = 4 WHERE "id" = 2
    #   # UPDATE "todos" SET "position" = 2 WHERE "id" = 4
    #   # UPDATE "todos" SET "position" = 1 WHERE "id" = 5
    #
    # <b>Remember!</b>  Your sort order list has to be the same length as the found items in the list, or your loop will fail.
    #
    #
    # === Wasteful scenario
    #
    # You can also use this version, but it will create upto <b>5 times as many SQL queries</b>. :(
    #
    #
    #   sort_order = ['5','4','3','2','1']    # list from AJAX request..
    #
    #   items = Todo.all(:user => @u1)        # loads all 5 items in the list
    #
    #   items.each{ |item| item.move(sort_order.index(item.id).to_i + 1) }   # remember the +1 since array's are indexed from 0
    #
    # The above code will result in something like these queries:
    #
    #   #  SELECT "id", "title", "position", "user_id" FROM "todos" WHERE "user_id" = 1 ORDER BY "position"
    #
    #   #  SELECT "id", "title", "position", "user_id" FROM "todos" WHERE "user_id" = 1 ORDER BY "position" DESC LIMIT 1
    #   #  SELECT "id" FROM "todos" WHERE "user_id" = 1 AND "id" IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) AND "position" BETWEEN 1 AND 5 ORDER BY "position"
    #   #  UPDATE "todos" SET "position" = "position" + -1 WHERE "user_id" = 1 AND "position" BETWEEN 1 AND 5
    #   #  SELECT "id", "position" FROM "todos" WHERE "id" IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) ORDER BY "id"
    #   #  UPDATE "todos" SET "position" = 5 WHERE "id" = 1
    #
    #   #  SELECT "id", "title", "position", "user_id" FROM "todos" WHERE "user_id" = 1 ORDER BY "position" DESC LIMIT 1
    #   #  SELECT "id" FROM "todos" WHERE "user_id" = 1 AND "id" IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) AND "position" BETWEEN 1 AND 4 ORDER BY "position"
    #   #  UPDATE "todos" SET "position" = "position" + -1 WHERE "user_id" = 1 AND "position" BETWEEN 1 AND 4
    #   #  SELECT "id", "position" FROM "todos" WHERE "id" IN (2, 3, 4, 5) ORDER BY "id"
    #   #  UPDATE "todos" SET "position" = 4 WHERE "id" = 2
    #
    #   #  ...
    #
    # As you can see it will also do the job, but will be more expensive.
